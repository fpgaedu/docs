# Developer Documentation
Within the FPGAedu project's scope, a developer concerns itself with the development of experimentation packages. Experimentation packages can be considered the project's unit of containment and distribution for experiment setup logic. Additional to the development of the actual experiment setup logic, a developer must encapsulate its work in order to conform to the project's specifications, such that end users can easily load and interact with the experiment setup.
